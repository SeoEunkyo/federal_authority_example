# oriento-odm

The module provides a wrapper class `DBClass` for an Orient-DB collection with a basic set of inheritable class and instance methods for data search and manipulation.

## Installation

```shell
npm install oriento-odm
```

Written and tested with `io.js`, but should contain no `io.js` specific code.

## Usage

Derive a class for your DB-class/cluster

```js
function User(data) {
  DBClass.apply(this, arguments);
  // initialise and properties here from `data`
}
DBClass.subclass(User);
```

Having defined a DB-class, the following class and instance methods are available:

```js



/** Subclasses User class into `ctor` taking over static and prototype methods */
User.subclass(ctor);

/** 
 * Creates a `storable` instance from data, adds `id` using `shortid` if not supplied, 
 * always, by design
 */
new User(data);

/** Creates the cluster */
User.create(db, callback);

/** Drops the cluster with all the data */
User.drop(db, callback)

/** 
 * Finds entries in the class cluster. The @rid is automatically converted to
 * #12:1 notation. All other @-properties are dropped.
 *
 * @db is an instance of `oriento` DB connection as returned by server.use(db)
 * @criteria see `oriento` (an object or a string of sort "a=25 order by a limit 1"
 * @callback a callback function with err and item(s) (wrapped as `User` instances)
 * @selectWhat optional argument to place between SELECT and WHERE, e.g. "*, out.name as #name"
 * 
 * Properties starting with @ or # will be ignored on save, so having joined data from
 * relations (as out.name above), it is recommended to name this starting with a #. Do not use @.
 */
User.find(db, criteria, callback, selectWhat);
User.findOne(db, criteria, callback, selectWhat);
User.findById(db, id, callback, selectWhat);

/** Inserts a new record or updates existing one (upsert) */
User.insert(db, data, callback);

/** Deletes records */
User.delete(db, criteria, callback);

user = new User();

/** 
 * Saves new or loaded instance: @-fields will be stripped off.
 */
user.save(db, callback);

/** Deletes a persisted instance */
user.delete(db, callback);

/** 
 * Links this instance to another instance `target` using the `clazz` relation class
 */
user.linkTo(db, target, clazz, callback);
```

### Running tests with Orient-DB

```shell
export TEST_ORIENTDB="host=localhost&port=2424&username=root&password=root&db=test" 
npm test
```
